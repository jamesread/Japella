# Connectors

Connectors are a way to connect Japella to a chat protocol. This means they are responsible for sending and receiving messages from the chat protocol, they are also responsible for handling the connection to the chat protocol.

You can see a list of chat protocols supported by Japella adaptors in the sidebar of this documentation page.
