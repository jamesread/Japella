= Getting Started

Assuming that you have installed Japella, the next step is to check that you can access the web interface and login.

The web UI runs on port 8080 by default, so you can access it by navigating to `http://<your-server-ip>:8080` in your web browser. If you are running Japella on your local machine, you can use `http://localhost:8080`.

== First login

When you first access the web interface, you will need to login. The default username is `admin` and the default password is `admin`. After logging in, you will be prompted to change the password. It is recommended to choose a strong password for security reasons.
